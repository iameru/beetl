**currently on halt as I do not find much time**!

a webapp to allow communities to bid on a target value and distribute the costs in a non fixed way.
its a small part of trying to even out financial inequality.

## example

a doctor, a gardener and a currently unemployed person decide to buy something together - they want to distribute the cost so that everyone can chip in by their own means.

here is what chatGPT has to say about it:

```
"When Jane and her roommates wanted to buy a new couch for their living room, they used our app to set a final price of $1,000 and each contributed a different amount based on their income. By using our app, they were able to split the cost fairly and make the purchase without anyone feeling financially burdened."

"Mark and his partner wanted to take a vacation but had different budgets. Using our app, they set a final price for the trip and each contributed a percentage of their income. With the cost split equitably, they were able to enjoy their trip without any financial stress."

"When the local soccer team needed to fundraise for new uniforms and equipment, they used our app to set a final fundraising goal and encourage members to contribute based on their ability. With our app's ability to track contributions and show progress towards the goal, the team was able to rally support from the entire community and make their vision a reality."
