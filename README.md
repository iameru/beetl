# beetl

**currently on halt as I do not find much time**!

a webapp to allow communities to bid on a target value and distribute the costs in a non fixed way.
its a small part of trying to even out financial inequality.

## example

a doctor, a gardener and a currently unemployed person decide to buy something together - they want to distribute the cost so that everyone can chip in by their own means. `beetl` organizes bidding rounds with different criteria to equalize financial differences.
